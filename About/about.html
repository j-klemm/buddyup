                <h2>What is BuddyUp?</h2>
                <p>
                    BuddyUp is a tool to help groups of friends plan and
                    save for regular trips by solving the biggest hurdles to
                    planning a group trip: deciding on a budget and
                    getting everybody to commit. By adding money to the
                    group’s funding, members commit to the trip early, so
                    the planning process gets easier after that. Safe,
                    secure, and fun payments let users see how much
                    they’ve raised and how much is left to go to help easily
                    fund their trips by making payments - big or small. Our
                    mission is to help groups of people stay friends for life
                    by allowing them to finally follow through on the plans
                    they want to make with each other.

                        Users create a trip with a
                        destination and add their friends
                        to the trip group. Next comes the
                        most important part! Each group
                        member starts contributing to
                        the cost of the trip until the goal
                        amount is met. The funds are
                        stored until the trip is fully
                        funded, or the user requests to
                        cash out the funds contributed.

                      <h2>Technical Summary</h2>
                      <p>
                          BuddyUp is a platform for groups of
                          friends to coordinate funding for
                          their trips. Users create accounts,
                          and anyone can create a trip to invite
                          their friends. When invited to a trip,
                          users can decline or accept the
                          invitation. Payment is handled with
                          the Stripe API. Trip data and user
                          data are stored in the COMP426
                          backend, and cash outs can be made
                          to the trip host at any point to retrieve
                          the pooled money.

                            The public datastore holds a list of users with the trips
                            they are part of. Payment details and contributions to
                            trips are held in the `user` datastore. Trip data is held
                            in the private datastore. The trip data is a list of trip
                            objects containing the host name, list of members who
                            are in the trip and have accepted the invite, a list of
                            members who have been invited but not yet accepted
                            the trip invite, the amount requested for the trip, and
                            the amount raised. Each user can see how much they
                            have contributed but cannot view how much others
                            have contributed.

                              Stripe builds the most powerful and
                              flexible tools for internet commerce.
                              Whether you’re creating a subscription
                              service, an on-demand marketplace, an
                              e-commerce store, or a crowdfunding
                              platform, Stripe’s meticulously designed
                              APIs and unmatched functionality help
                              you create the best possible product for
                              your users.
                              Payment is handled entirely by stripe for
                              security purposes. Users can choose
                              how much they want to contribute on
                              the BuddyUp site and are redirected to
                              Stripe to pay that amount using a
                              RESTful endpoint. Money is held in a
                              stripe account and can be deposited into
                              the host’s stripe or bank account upon
                              cash out.
